# AbsolutReader
AbsolutReader is the next generation e-book reader, 100% Open source, highly customizable, and featuring Chaimager. 
The plan is to make it available for Android, IOS and Windows/Mac/Linux, so that one can easily keep reading everywhere,
without the complications of using diferent apps.

For now, we only support Android, and Beta 0.1.3 is released, so make sure to give it a try.

Note for developers:  
I, **xVal**, am looking for people who might enjoy helping me with this project.
As you can see, the entire work until now was done by me, but the project is far from being completed, so 
everyone´s help is appreciated. This project is built using React Native 0.64, so Javascript is
essential. We use some native libraries, so if you speak java, you are welcome as well, since we need
to do a "cleanup" to make the app lightier, as well as some other stuff.
Although I can´t pay you (at least for now), I think the gratitude of making
something truly open to everyone is more than enough as a payment. Moreover, you can always add this to your curriculum :).
